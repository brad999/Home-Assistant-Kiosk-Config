# Home-Assistant-Kiosk-Config
My home-assistant lovelace configuration for my kiosk. I've included all relevant config to get this working. I haven't uploaded my full HA config as I need to clean it up first.

Credit to @TeNpoLe21 for the inspiration of the overall design and the use of his config for some sensors

The code to make lovelace fullscreen was taken from @ciotlosm and can be found here:
